# RADM Blue Team Implementation TODO

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Created Blue Team Package (`internal/blueteam/blueteam.go`)
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive Blue Team with self-healing mechanisms
- âœ… Added healing strategies: circuit breaker, fallback mode, resource cleanup, config reload
- âœ… Added issue types: high latency, high error rate, resource exhaustion, compliance failure
- âœ… Implemented monitoring and automatic healing triggers
- âœ… Added healing action tracking and statistics

### 2. Integrated Blue Team in Main Application (`cmd/radm/main.go`)
- âœ… Added Blue Team initialization in `initializeComponents()`
- âœ… Added Blue Team endpoints: `/blueteam/status` and `/blueteam/heal/{type}`
- âœ… Implemented handlers: `blueTeamStatusHandler` and `blueTeamHealHandler`
- âœ… Added self-healing triggers in ingest handler for Axiom A-2 and A-4 compliance
- âœ… Added graceful shutdown for Blue Team monitoring

### 3. Enhanced Hypervisor for Time-to-Heal Tracking (`internal/hypervisor/hypervisor.go`)
- âœ… Added healing tracking fields: `healingStartTime`, `isHealing`, `timeToHeal`
- âœ… Integrated with Blue Team for compliance violation detection
- âœ… Self-healing triggers when P95 latency > 50ms (Axiom A-2) or monetization accuracy < 99.999%

### 4. Added Methods to Anomaly Detector (`anomaly/anomaly.go`)
- âœ… Added `AdjustThreshold()` method for Blue Team patching
- âœ… Added `AdjustWindowSize()` method for Blue Team patching
- âœ… Added `log` import for logging adjustments

## Remaining Tasks ðŸ”„

### 1. Add DefaultConfig for Blue Team
- Need to add `DefaultConfig()` function in `blueteam.go` to match the pattern used in other packages

### 2. Update Config Package
- Add Blue Team configuration section to `config.go`
- Update config validation and loading

### 3. Add Blue Team to Metrics Endpoint
- Update `metricsHandler` to include Blue Team statistics
- Add `getBlueTeamStats()` to metrics response

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Add unit tests for Blue Team functionality
- Add integration tests for self-healing scenarios
- Test Axiom A-3 compliance (Time-to-Heal â‰¤ 60s)

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Update API documentation for new Blue Team endpoints
- Update README with Blue Team features
- Add Blue Team section to SECURITY.md

## Key Features Implemented

### Self-Healing Mechanisms
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Continuous health checks every 5 minutes
- **Compliance Violation Detection**: Triggers healing when Axioms A-2 or A-4 are violated
- **Multiple Healing Strategies**:
  - Circuit Breaker: For high latency issues
  - Fallback Mode: For high error rates
  - Resource Cleanup: For resource exhaustion
  - Config Reload: For compliance failures

### Time-to-Heal Tracking (Axiom A-3)
- Tracks healing duration from start to completion
- Logs warnings if healing exceeds 60 seconds
- Integrated with hypervisor SBOH metrics

### API Endpoints
- `GET /blueteam/status`: Get healing statistics and history
- `POST /blueteam/heal/{type}?strategy={strategy}`: Manually trigger healing

### Integration Points
- Hypervisor: Detects compliance violations
- Red Team: Can inject faults that trigger healing
- Audit: Logs all healing actions and compliance checks
- Main Ingest: Automatic healing triggers on violations

## Testing Commands (when Go is available)

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run in development mode
make dev

# Check metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Check Blue Team status
curl http://localhost:8080/blueteam/status

# Manually trigger healing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/blueteam/heal/high_latency?strategy=circuit_breaker"
```

## Compliance with Axioms

- **Axiom A-1 (Determinism)**: Maintained through existing checkpoint system
- **Axiom A-2 (Latency â‰¤ 50ms P95)**: Monitored and healed by Blue Team
- **Axiom A-3 (Time-to-Heal â‰¤ 60s)**: Tracked and enforced by Blue Team
- **Axiom A-4 (Monetization Accuracy)**: Monitored and healed by Blue Team

The Blue Team implementation provides comprehensive self-healing capabilities that maintain system compliance with all Axioms while tracking and reporting healing effectiveness.
